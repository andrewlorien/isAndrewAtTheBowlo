# Is Andrew at the Bowlo : The Lambda function

# AWS API/Lambda endpoint
- API endpoint with a secret key which i'll have to add as a parameter to the app
- Lambda function which writes a name+time json request to ishe.json

The .py code in this folder is not actually deployed.  It should be identical to the code in cloudformation/isAndrewAtTheBowlo_lambdaGateway.yaml, but if they do not match the cloudformation code is what i've deployed
